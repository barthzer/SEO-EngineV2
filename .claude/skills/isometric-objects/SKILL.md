# Isometric Objects

You draw isometric objects by modeling them in 3D and projecting to 2D with code. You never eyeball angles. Every edge comes from a projected point, so everything lines up.

Style target: a technical figure. Near-black solids, hairline edges, nested insets, small mechanical details, one lit focal point. Quiet everywhere except the one place you want the eye to go.

## 1. Projection

Use true isometric. World axes: x goes right-down, y goes left-down, z goes up.

```js
const C = Math.cos(Math.PI / 6), S = 0.5;            // 30 degrees
const iso = (x, y, z, s = 1) => [(x - y) * C * s, ((x + y) * S - z) * s];
```

- Pick one unit (for example 1 unit = 8 px) and model in whole or half units.
- Center the object with a single translate on the root group. Do not offset individual parts.
- For pixel-art crispness use 2:1 dimetric instead (`C = 1, S = 0.5`). Do not mix the two.

## 2. Build from primitives

Write small helpers and compose them. Each returns SVG path strings for its visible faces.

- `box(x, y, z, w, d, h)`: three visible faces: top, left (+y side), right (+x side).
- `roundedBox(..., r)`: same, plus a second hairline on each vertical edge, offset by r, to read as a rounded corner.
- `inset(face, margin, depth)`: a recessed panel on a face: outer frame line, inner frame line, darker fill. Nest 2 or 3 for bezels (screen, drawer, port).
- `slots(face, n, gap)`: vents. Short parallel lines that run along one face axis.
- `cylinder(cx, cy, z, r, h)`: top ellipse, side band, bottom half ellipse. Ellipse ratio follows the projection (rx = r * C * 2^0.5, ry = rx / 3^0.5 on a top face).
- `helix(path3d, r, turns)`: coiled cables. Sample in 3D, project, draw as one polyline.
- `grid(face, cols, rows, keyFn)`: keyboards, solar panels, tiles, server bays.

A detail on a face is drawn in that face's plane: project its 3D corners. A vent on the right face slants with the right face.

## 3. Depth order

- Painter's algorithm. Sort solids by `x + y + z` of their far corner (larger draws later). Ties: draw the lower z first.
- Inside one solid: top, then left, then right, then details, then edge lines last.
- Tall or overlapping parts: split them into unit blocks before sorting.
- Wrap each face's details in a `clipPath` of that face. Details then cannot bleed onto a neighbor face. This is the main fix for "small parts overlap".
- Keep details at least 0.25 unit in from face edges.

## 4. Shading

Three tones per material, fixed light from the top-left:

| face  | dark theme (on #0f0f0f to #141414 page) | light theme (on #ececec page) |
|-------|------|------|
| top   | #1f1f1f | #ffffff |
| left  | #181818 | #f2f2f2 |
| right | #121212 | #e2e2e2 |
| stroke | rgba(255,255,255,0.18 to 0.32) | rgba(20,20,30,0.35 to 0.55) |
| silhouette stroke | rgba(255,255,255,0.45) | rgba(20,20,30,0.75) |

- Drive colors from CSS custom properties (`--iso-top`, `--iso-left`, `--iso-right`, `--iso-line`, `--iso-accent`) so one asset works in both themes.
- No gradients on solids. Gradients only for light: a screen glow, an LED halo, a soft contact shadow under the object.
- Contact shadow: one blurred ellipse or projected footprint at z = 0, 20 to 35 percent opacity.

## 5. Lines

- `vector-effect: non-scaling-stroke`, width 1 px at display size (0.75 for interior details).
- `stroke-linejoin: round; stroke-linecap: round`.
- Three line weights only: silhouette, edges, detail. Detail lines are dimmer, not thinner than 0.75.
- Use a hairline highlight (brighter, 1 px) on the top-front edge of key solids. That one line sells the material.

## 6. Composition

- Put the object on a plinth or base plate. A thin slab larger than the footprint, with a chamfer line and a couple of screws.
- One accent color, used on at most 5 percent of the pixels: a screen, an LED, a moving packet. Everything else is greyscale.
- Leave 15 to 25 percent padding. The object sits slightly above center.
- Optional figure frame: `Fig 2` top-left, a name like `DESK COMPUTER` top-right, a caption or live state bottom row. Monospace, uppercase, 0.12em tracking, 45 to 60 percent opacity.
- Detail density: three levels. Big forms, then insets, then micro details (screws, LEDs, vents, labels). Stop at three.

## 7. Motion

Everything moves as a function of one loop phase `p` in [0, 1). No accumulated state, no `Math.random()` at frame time.

```js
const TAU = Math.PI * 2;
const p = ((now - t0) / DURATION) % 1;
const wave = Math.sin(TAU * (p * k + offset));   // integer k only
const ease = t => t < .5 ? 4*t*t*t : 1 - (-2*t + 2) ** 3 / 2;
```

- Integer cycle counts (`k`) guarantee frame `p = 0` equals frame `p = 1`. Check it: render both and diff.
- Movement happens along iso axes. Things slide on x, y, or z, never in screen space.
- Prefer few large confident moves (lift, slide, assemble) over many small jitters. Hold for 15 to 30 percent of the loop so the eye can rest.
- Exploded views are the strongest move: parts separate along z with leader lines and labels, hold, then reassemble.
- Use seeded randomness (`mulberry32(seed)`) for layout, computed once.
- Expose `render(p)` so the same code drives live playback and frame-exact video capture.
- `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`: render one well-composed still (usually `p` at the hold).
- Pause when off-screen (IntersectionObserver) and when the tab is hidden.

## 8. Output

- Default: one self-contained SVG or HTML file, no dependencies. `viewBox` set, no fixed width.
- Canvas2D when you draw more than ~1,500 shapes per frame. Same projection, same palette.
- WebGL only for light effects (glow, bloom, ignition) layered over the vector drawing.
- Keep site assets under 30 KB gzipped.

## 9. Process

1. Write down the object as a parts list with sizes in units. Sketch the footprint.
2. Model big forms with `box` / `cylinder`. Render. Check silhouette and proportions.
3. Add insets and bezels. Render.
4. Add micro details, one face at a time, clipped.
5. Add the focal light and the accent.
6. Add motion with `render(p)`. Verify the loop seam.
7. Screenshot at 1x and 2x, on dark and light. Fix any line that crosses a face it does not belong to.

## Checklist

- [ ] Every point comes from `iso()`. No hand-placed coordinates.
- [ ] Details clipped to their face, inset from edges.
- [ ] Three tones per material, one accent, glow only on the focal point.
- [ ] Hairlines stay 1 px at any size.
- [ ] Loop: frame 0 equals frame N. Integer cycles. Hold beats exist.
- [ ] Reduced motion gives a good still. Off-screen pauses.
- [ ] Works on dark and light backgrounds.
